We Become What We Behold is a web game independently produced by Nicky Case. In the game, players play the role of the major news media to control people's attitudes and opinions towards events. The game's visual style is very approachable and flat, with cartoon characters with cute faces, humorous actions, and sound effects. As a viewer, I felt drawn to the simplicity and relaxed style of the game. One of the characteristics of the game art form is that it is very interactive. As a viewer, I am also a part of the game, and the experience of the game is very crucial to its audience. I think Nicky Case has a very high degree of experience completion. When entering the game, the content is very simple, only a few similar and regular movement of the small people on the screen. The user turned the mouse pointer into a viewfinder with the simple instruction of "point click". The whole interface made me feel very relaxed and amused, and curious about what would happen next.

However, as the game went on, the harmonious and pleasant atmosphere was gradually destroyed by my shooting choices, and the whole game world became full of conflict and hatred. At the end of the game, both the graphics and sound become bloody and scary, in sharp contrast to the previous peaceful scene, and this contrast gives me a strong psychological impact. During this process, I felt that as the photographer, I gradually lost control over the direction of events and public opinion, which was disturbing. In this process, I increasingly feel uneasy. It wasn't until the end of the game that I fully realized that my action was irreversible and heartbreaking. In this process, Nicky Case by using the strategy from micro to macro induced the player to his preset steps, this process is very natural, so that it is difficult for players to feel restricted and realize their own behavior artists have been carefully designed. I think it is very successful for players to experience design, which allows the player to personally experience the meanings behind the work.

The game's interactivity is simple, funny, and engaging, and Nicky Case's success in this regard is undeniable. In my second attempt to play again, I found some details I hadn't noticed the first time, such as the couple calming down the crazy square, only to be told after filming that people wanted to see more conflict and anger. This gives me a deeper understanding of the meaning behind this work, which somehow indicates that good interactive work can allow the audience to experience repeatedly, and find a new experience and feeling in the process of each experience.
