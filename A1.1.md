Bad writing - or maybe we should call it bad creating? As the author mentioned, bad writing always reproduces common tropes, lack of creativity, details, and subjectivity... I also often make this mistake. Sometimes I wrote or made things that are blurry and hard to explain. I thought it could produce a sense of mystery that could inspire other people to think. However, I know it could be my lazy step to take since I simply put some tasks and creating responsibility for my audience. It is absurd for creators to skip the active thinking part in the creating process - by using some common image/language to impose an undefined and unclear feeling on the audience. At the same time, it is not carrying any weight or content inside. The illusion of compassion or empathy created by the audience themselves is not embedded in any entity, and it is not reliable as well. I do not think writing - creating - has to rely on an independent entity that carries specific meanings, which could leave little space for the audience to experience. The audience needs to breathe, like artistic work. Leaving space for each other is necessary, but the prerequisite for creators is to understand the works' technique, subject, genre, and form thoroughly, and it could be an important message I received from the passage and the course as well, I think.
