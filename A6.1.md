New words! Algorithm citizen! I never knew the concept, but I always felt it. Whenever I open Twitter or YouTube, the app pushes out content that often makes me think I'm not in the United States. The software knows where I come from, my native language, and my interests to judge what I like to see. For the convenience of life, this is not a bad thing. I've always understood that there's a trade-off between privacy and convenience, and I've often "acquiesced" in letting software access or "sell" my information in exchange for my convenience. However, beyond that, I overlooked the potential blind threat it could pose to me. The concept of algorithmic citizenship is like letting a stranger have a first-hand profile of you and choose the topic of conversation based on what you want to see and hear. If this were to happen in real life, I would be grateful to have such a smart friend; But when all the sources in my life start customizing content for me, I become passive and blind. I'm not too fond of this description, but I feel like I'm naked on the Internet. From the moment I entered the virtual world, I had been given a virtual identity, and I had never been given the right to be entirely out of it. Just like if I deactivate my account on social media, my information will not be immediately deleted. And by that time, the information had probably spread to other places where I was concerned. It's a world of infinite cycles, and I'm only exposed more and more to the Internet, which means that the space I can leave entirely to myself is compressed less and less.

As reported in Online Harassment and Digital Abuse, online harassment and abuse can affect many aspects of our digital lives. The Internet environment is used to create a threatening, annoying, frightening, and even hostile environment for victims. Even those who have not directly experienced online harassment can see it and react to its impact. Even the threat of harassment can silence the voices of many of our citizens. Would we still have the opportunity to speak out against, talk about, and even merely be aware of what is going on around us in the future Internet?
