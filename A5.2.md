John Perry Barlow's manifesto had a simple message: governments should not and cannot rule the Internet. In the declaration, he stated governments that they were not welcome in cyberspace and that they had no sovereignty over it. He pointed out that the Internet, as global cyberspace, is naturally free from the tyranny imposed by any single individual. Yet more than two decades later, we still seem to be living in an era of mass surveillance by the NSA, the firewall of China, and the FBI's enforcement of the dark web.

I think Barlow's idea is very novel to me. He challenged what I had always thought was a given: that the Internet belonged to a national government. Barlow believes that the Internet world, as a virtual world, should exist in parallel with the real world. It is not a derivative of the real world. On the contrary, it was created by each individual and should not be subject to any of the existing rules of the real world. "Ours is a world that is both everywhere and nowhere, but It is not where bodies live."

I think his proposal is very inspiring because he got me to realize for the first time that the Internet, as the virtual world, is not established and developed by the government. Therefore the government does not have the full power and ability to regulate the Internet. Still, I have some doubts about the concept. For instance, the Internet, as a virtual world, often mirrors real-world situations and experiences. Although the Internet exists independently of entities in three-dimensional space, all the people who contribute to the construction of this virtual world are definitely entities in the real world. The influence people have on the virtual world is often based on existing ideologies in the real world, and this closeness makes it difficult to fully separate the Internet from the real world. Similarly, although no one has absolute authority to set the rules of the Internet, it is for this reason that everyone's ideology has become the standard of the Internet. And when we talk about personal ideology, the question is brought back to reality.

I do acknowledge that the government's absolute control of the Internet is questionable: the Internet, as a rapidly expanding virtual world, has grown much more vast than we can imagine. As a result, it has become difficult for us as real people to define or even realize its boundary with our real life. The boundary between the two is becoming increasingly blurred. Still, there is also an urgent need to reflect more deeply about whether the virtual world is parallel to us or tightly bound to us.
