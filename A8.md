I used to be a champion of Internet algorithms and big data. However, the potential consequences of extrapolating what users want from their implicit information (such as browsing history, search trends, user group behavior predictions) and even determining what they see or use are impossible to predict. Do users really need them? Are the decisions made by the algorithm really beneficial to the user? Who decides, and how, the interests of users are determined? How should we choose between convenience and privacy as users? As a business or organization, how to balance them? These concerns force me to face its defects. We don't know enough about algorithms and big data, just as they don't know enough about us. Applying them now on a large scale and in-depth may not be a deliberate decision. I hope these considerations can be properly worked out/expressed in the medium of the algorithm and the data itself. If a chaotic set of data is imported into the same algorithm, and the calculated result is presented to the corresponding user, will the life of the user receiving the "wrong result" be affected? On the contrary, if users have the right to choose different algorithms actively rather than being decided by Internet companies or institutions, how will users choose the algorithm that best suits them? Will this further improve the user experience and maximize their benefits?
