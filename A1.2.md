Art is like a way of expressing myself. As Diaz mentioned, “One of the ways we inhabit a space of multiplicity is through our languages.” I see art as one of the language abilities that people are born with. Just like our spoken language and written language, they all can be used to express themselves, but they have their own advantages. For instance, spoken language is suitable for the instant and quick-response of information exchange, while the written words are more suitable for the occasion of sharing thoughts. For me, spoken language is far more complicated than writing language and artistic language, since I am more comfortable with coming up with the full story, rather than improvising, which also reflects the source of my creative inspiration. Art is like my language, and therefore my creativity comes from myself. So what I often think about when I am creating is what my emotions of this work are? What do I hope it means to me? These questions are like quick thoughts in my mind when I am using spoken language. But when it comes to making art, it allows me to consider these questions more carefully. Not only that, but it's also essential to think from the perspective of my audience: how much can I relate to the speaker as a listener? How do I want to experience it? Therefore, it is crucial to find the appropriate artistic expression. One of the main reasons I love new media, or more accurately, electronic media, is its diversity and the plasticity of experience shaping. This sense of belonging is, in my opinion, particularly crucial for the communication between "listener" and "speaker." Since I am putting myself as both the “listener” and “speaker” in creating an artistic process, the creative content is no longer necessarily outside of the mainstream. Independence is more important than extraordinary, I think. The creator's understanding of the work must be clear enough, which means that if one cannot achieve independence of thought or creation, the resulting work will be challenging to justify. Personally, I rarely look at other people's work when creating creative content because it's hard not to be influenced by other people's ideas or forms. And once these subtle thoughts influence me, I often can't define exactly what my creative expression is. Therefore, in my opinion, the creator does not need to give self a precise positioning in advance. Instead, he/she should think about where he/she is now standing and where he/she wants to reach through artistic language.
