This Friday I went to MoMA to visit Shahryar Nashat's Force Life. This work was placed in The Marie-Josee and Henry Kravis Studio. It was a very wide space, with black walls and a whole pane of glass directly in front of the view. When I first entered the space, the light overhead was pale blue, the video on the screen showed a man lying on the ground, and many viewers were sitting on the ground watching, so I felt very relaxed. But it did not last for long; I was startled by the sound of a loud, repetitive blow. The light overhead turned blood red, and I gradually felt the eerie feeling of the environment and the anxiety it brought to me. The video shown on the screen is unfocused and cryptic: at the center of the video is a prone body scanned by the camera, which constantly shifts across the body as if it were analyzing its components. Animals captured on CCTV also create a sense of menace; it was playing similar but slightly different clips over and over again, and I could feel the pace of the video picking up. With the background sound, I felt a very strong sense of anxiety and insecurity. There were also three sculptures in the middle of the space, but I didn't get a good sense of the experience they brought to me. The existence of these three white sculptures is very harmonious with the environment, but their position and appearance brought me many different and unrelated associations: such as pillars, benches, muscle fibers... In the moment of thinking, I felt that I was gradually separated from the work. One of the interesting things is that when I first came to this space, the audience was sitting and I was standing. After watching the first video and wondering about the meaning of the work, I decided to sit down and feel it. But this time, I felt a peace that I had never felt before, that I felt closer to every element of the work. The contrast between the two experiences made me feel that I was really "in" the work, which impressed me deeply.
